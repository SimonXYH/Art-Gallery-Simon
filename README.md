# The Art Gallery
One of the main reasons I am so deeply passionate about physics, mathematics, and science in general is the intrinsic beauty of the ideas they explore. I love visualizing the abstract things, and the concrete things. I am fascinated by simulation, it's almost ridiculous how much joy I can get from just watching a single dot moing on the screen while a number is hold fixed (energy). 
Here, I have gathered a selection of my favorite Desmos creations, in the hope of sharing with others the same sense of awe and beauty that first drew me to these subjects.
Electrons, Link and Fibration:

Mobius ball: (I have strong feelings toward this graph, this is the first 3D graph I have made, I thought how cool it will be if I can animate this ball just rolling on the mobius strip, and this movie really lingered in my head for days. To be precise, in the original version there is no illumination)
